Wordpress copy of somekind ++

## What?

To build a blog CMS Wordpress type site that uses:

* Postgres
* Hapi
* Node
* Handlebars

## How?

* To include a login page that will add users to a database when they click 'Register'
* To allow users to login again once added to the database and remain logged in when they have clicked 'Log In'
* Allow users to add a blog post via a form and 'Post' button
* Refresh the page when a new post is added and return the 20 latest blog post after each time the page is rendered, whether this be when a new post is submitted or on the window.load.

## To Run

Clone this repo onto your local machine.

1. Run 'npm install' in your terminal
2. At this point you will need to gitter us to get the URL to export and run the database.
3. This point will be explained to us via gitter after you message us for point 2.
4. Back to your original tab now and run 'npm start'
5. Go to your browser and use 'localhost:3000'

You can now sign up to make blog posts by clicking the 'sign in' button.
Once you have done this you can make a blog post usign the form and the 'post' button.

## Stretch Goals

* Deploy to Heroku
* Make the site pretty using SASS
